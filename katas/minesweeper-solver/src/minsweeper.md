# Minesweeper Solver Challenge

## Problem Description

The challenge involves simulating the logical deduction process of the Minesweeper game to determine the final state of the game board. Given an initial map (a grid with `?` for unknown cells, `0` for known safe cells, and numbers indicating adjacent mines) and a total number of mines (`n`), the task is to:

1. **Open safe cells** starting from cells adjacent to zeros (since `0` implies no adjacent mines).
2. **Deduce mine positions** based on the numbers revealed from opened cells.
3. **Mark all mines** (`x`) and **open all safe cells**.
4. Return the **final solved board** if unambiguous, or `?` if the solution is ambiguous or invalid.

2 x 2 0 1 x
2 x 2 1 2 2
1 1 1 1 x 1
0 0 0 1 1 1
```

## Approach

### Key Steps

1. **Parse the Input**:
    * Convert the input map into a 2D grid for easier manipulation.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) for Safe Cells**:
    * Start by processing cells adjacent to zeros (safe cells) and open them to reveal numbers.
    * Use a queue to manage cells to be processed.
3. **Deduce Mines and Safe Cells**:
    * For each revealed number, calculate the number of adjacent mines already marked (`x`) and the remaining unknowns (`?`).
    * If the number of remaining unknowns matches the required mines, mark them as mines.
    * If all required mines are already marked, treat remaining unknowns as safe and add them to the queue.
4. **Check for Ambiguity**:
    * After processing all deductions, check if remaining unknowns can be definitively resolved as mines or safe cells.
    * If the remaining unknowns match the number of unmarked mines, validate the configuration.
5. **Validation**:
    * Ensure all numbered cells correctly reflect the count of adjacent mines.
    * Verify the total number of marked mines equals `n`.

### Solution Code (Rust)

The solution is implemented as a Rust crate. Key components include:

1. **Game Trait**:

```
pub trait Game {
    fn open(&self, row: usize, col: usize) -> u8;

```

5. `}`
    * Simulates opening a cell in Minesweeper and returns the number of adjacent mines.
6. **Solve Function**:
    * Processes the grid using BFS and logical deduction.
    * Uses queues to manage safe cells and mines to mark.
    * Validates the final grid configuration.
7. **Validation Function**:
    * Checks if the final grid adheres to Minesweeper rules.

## Solution Explanation

### Workflow

1. **Initialization**:
    * Convert the input map into a grid and initialize a queue for cells adjacent to zeros.
2. **BFS Processing**:
    * Open cells in the queue, revealing numbers.
    * Add newly discovered safe cells (adjacent to zeros) to the queue.
3. **Deduction Loop**:
    * Analyze numbered cells to deduce mines and safe cells.
    * Mark mines or add safe cells to the queue based on deductions.
4. **Final Checks**:
    * If all mines are marked and cells opened, return the solved grid.
    * If remaining unknowns match the number of unmarked mines, validate and return the grid.
    * If ambiguity remains, return `?`.

### Edge Cases

* **Ambiguous Configurations**: When multiple valid configurations exist (e.g., two unknowns left with one mine remaining).
* **Invalid Configurations**: When deductions lead to contradictions (e.g., a numbered cell’s count mismatches adjacent mines).

### Complexity

* **Time**:
* O(rows×cols)
* *O*(*rows*×*cols*) for grid traversal and BFS processing.
* **Space**:
* O(rows×cols)
* *O*(*rows*×*cols*) for storing the grid and queues.

## Conclusion

This solution efficiently simulates the logical deduction process of Minesweeper by combining BFS for safe cell exploration and iterative deduction for mine placement. It ensures correctness by validating the final configuration and handles ambiguity by returning `?` when no unique solution exists.
